# Thayan Enclave

This is a new feature that we currently know very little about. All we really have are a few text key defines.

From the text it seems that Corrupted Gems will be collectible by killing "Red Wizards" during "Emergence" Events. These will be able to be spent on "Marvelous Support Pigment" (dyes?) which increase damage when placed on epic equipment.

Beyond that - there's nothing else to go on yet. Certainly no date.

## Corrupted Gem Shop Items

* Golden Epic: Krydle (Slot 3)
* Feat: Second Wind (Shandie)
* Feat: Second Wind (Shandie)
* Feat: Second Wind (Shandie) (Yes 3 times)
* Skin: Red Wizard Widdle
* Skin: Red Wizard Calliope
* Red Wizard Emergence Chest (x1)
* Supply Chest (x1)
* Modron Component Chest (x1)
* Marvelous Support Pigment (x1)
