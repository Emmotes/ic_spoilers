# Changes

The information below is raw data on the "new" abilities that the champions will be getting. Some may be complete reworks - some may look copy-paste from old abilities that haven't seen reworks yet (and might not get reworked).

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.

## Krydle

> Increase the damage of all Champions in the back two columns of the formation by `$(amount)%`.

> Krydle increases the effect of From The Shadows by `$(not_buffed amount)%` for each Champion with the Heroes of Baldur's Gate affiliation or a CHA score of 15 or higher, stacking multiplicatively.

> Krydle begins every area with stacks of Evasion equal to his Overwhelm. When Krydle gets attacked, as long as he has at least one stack of Evasion left, he dodges the attack completely and uses up one stack of Evasion. Krydle restores 2 stacks of Evasion every second for each Healing Champion in the formation. Number of stacks can not surpass his Overwhelm. If a boss or enemies are enraged, max stacks are divided by the enrage multiplier, rounded down.

> Krydle gains `$(not_buffed amount)` Overwhelm for each Heroes of Baldur's Gate Champion in the formation.

> Krydle reduces the damage taken by other Champions in the formation by `$(amount)%`, assuming he has at least one stack of Evasion and is in the front-most column of the formation.

> Increase the effect of Charismatic Leader by `$(amount)%`.

> Krydle's base max health is increased by `$(not_buffed amount)%` for every 50 areas completed, up to area 600.

Reverse Pickpocket
> Krydle attacks a random enemy with his daggers. While doing so, he reverse pick-pockets a smokepowder bomb onto their person, which explodes for which deals 3 seconds of BUD damage in a small radius after 3 seconds if the enemy is not killed in the meantime.

## Jaheira

> `$(text_key tag___3)` enemies are Jaheira's Favored Foe. When an enemy of her Favored Foe type is attacked (by any Champion), Jaheira gains a Hunter stack. This increases her damage by `$(not_buffed amount)%` per stack and increases the effect of Class Act by `$(not_buffed amount___2)%` per stack, stacking additively. Maximum `$(max_stacks)` stacks. Stacks are reset when you change areas.

> After `$(favored_foes_kills_to_trigger)` of Jaheira's Favored Foes have been killed, this ability activates and she becomes more focused, increasing the effects of Fierce Hunter by `$(not_buffed amount)%` until you change areas.

> Jaheira gains `$(time_stack)` stack of Persistent Focus every `$(stack_time)` seconds while Battle Focus is active, and `$(expire_stack)` stack when it expires. This increases the damage of all Champions, including herself, by `$(not_buffed amount)%` per stack, stacking additively.

> Increase the effect of Class Act by `$(not_buffed amount)%` for each Champion affected by it, stacking multiplicatively.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Clerics, Wizards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Barbarians, Fighters, Rogues and Monks by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Paladins, Rangers, Druids, and Bards by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Champions from the Heroes of Baldur's Gate affiliation by `$(amount)%`.

> Beast enemies are Jaheira's Favored Foe. When a Beast enemy dies, Jaheira gains a Hunter stack. This increases her damage by 400% and increases the effect of Class Act by 200% per stack, stacking additively. Maximum 10 stacks. Stacks are reset when you change areas.

> Jaheira continues to be a Fierce Hunter of Beast creatures.

> Fiends are Jaheira's new Favored Foe. Jaheira's Fierce Hunter and Battle Focus ability now trigger off of Fiend creatures instead of Beasts.

> Humanoids are Jaheira's new Favored Foe. Jaheira's Fierce Hunter and Battle Focus ability now trigger off of Humanoid creatures instead of Beasts.

> Undead are Jaheira's new Favored Foe. Jaheira's Fierce Hunter and Battle Focus ability now trigger off of Undead creatures instead of Beasts.

Tangling Scimitar
> Jaheira attacks the nearest enemy with her scimitar and then summons roots to hold them in place for 3 seconds. The roots also damage and root other nearby enemies.

## Nerys

Dash and Slash
> Nerys cleaves all targets near the closest enemy. Undead enemies take an additional 5 seconds worth of BUD damage.

> Nerys calls her Spiritual Weapon to her side. It attacks on her attack timer, dealing `$(amount)%` of Nerys' damage. Spiritual Weapon attacks can set BUD (crediting Nerys).  

> Nerys' Spiritual Weapon follows the Champion with the highest damage instead of her. It attacks on that Champions attack timer, dealing damage based on their damage instead of Nerys'. If those attacks are BUD-setting, then the Champion it is following gets credit for setting the BUD.

> When Nerys' Spiritual Weapon attacks, Nerys targets the column with the most damaged Champion and heals all the Champions in it for $(amount) health.

> Increases the damage of Spiritual Weapon against all Favored Foes by `$(amount)%`

## Shandie

> When the formation is under attack, Shandie attacks with explosive arrows. The damage of all Champions is increased by `$(amount)%` times the largest number of enemies Shandie has hit with a single Explosive Arrow in the current area.

> Increases the damage of Champions within 2 slots of Shandie by `$(amount)%` for each Champion adjacent to Shandie with a DEX of 15 or higher.

> The base effect of Agile Allies is additively increased by `$(amount)%` for each Heroes' of Baldur's Gate affiliated Champion in the formation.

> The base effect of Agile Allies is additively increased by 100% for each Neutral/Evil Champion adjacent to Shandie.

> Increases the game speed by `$(amount)%` when the formation hasn't been under attack for `$(delay seconds)`.

## Viconia

> Whenever a non-boss, non-static, non-undead enemy spawns there is a `$(amount)%` chance that it spawns as an undead version of itself while also retaining its original tags.
