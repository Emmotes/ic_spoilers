# Season 2
This is what I believe we know about Season 2.

# Theme
Given the changes that have been popping up in the defines - it seems Season 2's theme and rebalances will be around the Heroes of Baldur's Gate. We don't know as yet which 5 will be chosen for the reworks - but the developers have said no Evergreens will be likely to see balances.

## Krydle
So far all we have are new ability descriptions that were added.

> Increase the damage of all Champions in the back two columns of the formation by `$(amount)%`.

> Krydle increases the effect of From The Shadows by `$(amount)%` for each Champion with the Heroes of Baldur's Gate affiliation or a CHA score of 15 or higher, stacking multiplicatively.

> Krydle begins every area with stacks of Evasion equal to his Overwhelm. When Krydle gets attacked, as long as he has at least one stack of Evasion left, he dodges the attack completely and uses up one stack of Evasion. Krydle restores 2 stacks of Evasion every second for each Healing Champion in the formation. Number of stacks can not surpass his Overwhelm. If a boss or enemies are enraged, max stacks are divided by the enrage multiplier, rounded down.

> Krydle gains `$(amount)` Overwhelm for each Heroes of Baldur's Gate Champion in the formation.

> Krydle reduces the damage taken by other Champions in the formation by `$(amount)%`, assuming he has at least one stack of Evasion and is in the front-most column of the formation.

> Increase the effect of Charismatic Leader by `$(amount)%`.

> KKrydle's base max health is increased by `$(amount)%` for every 50 areas completed, up to area 600.

Reverse Pickpocket
> Krydle attacks a random enemy with his daggers. While doing so, he reverse pick-pockets a smokepowder bomb onto their person, which explodes for which deals 3 seconds of BUD damage in a small radius after 3 seconds if the enemy is not killed in the meantime.

## Jaheira
Tangling Scimitar
> Jaheira attacks the nearest enemy with her scimitar, briefly rooting them in place with some vines.

> Beast enemies are Jaheira's Favored Foe. When an enemy of her Favored Foe type is attacked (by any Champion), Jaheira gains a Hunter stack. This increases her damage by 200% per stack and increases the effect of Class Act by 100% per stack, stacking additively. Maximum 20 stacks. Stacks are reset when you change areas.

> After 20 of Jaheira's Favored Foes have been killed, this ability activates and she becomes more focused, increasing the effects of Fierce Hunter by `$(amount)%` until you change areas. Once Persistent Focus is unlocked, she gains one stack of Persistent Focus every 30 seconds while Battle Focus is active, and one stack when it expires.

> Jaheira increases the damage of all Champions, including herself, by `$(amount)%` for each stack of Persistent Focus she has, stacking additively.

> Increase the effect of Class Act by `$(amount)%` for each Champion affected by it, stacking multiplicatively.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Clerics, Wizards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Barbarians, Fighters, Rogues and Monks by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Paladins, Rangers, Druids, and Bards by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira increases the damage of Champions from the Heroes of Baldur's Gate affiliation by `$(amount)%`.

> Jaheira continues to be a Fierce Hunter of Beast creatures.

> Humanoids are Jaheira's new Favored Foe. Jaheira's Fierce Hunter and Battle Focus ability now trigger off of Humanoid creatures instead of Beasts.

> Undead are Jaheira's new Favored Foe. Jaheira's Fierce Hunter and Battle Focus ability now trigger off of Undead creatures instead of Beasts.
