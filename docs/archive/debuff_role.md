# Debuff Role

With Ezmerelda's rework - there's hints that there'll be a new Debuff role. Below is a list of champions who currently have it (but don't yet show it).

There's not enough data to say whether getting the debuff role will mean the removal of the support role for any champion. The current assumption is that the debuff role will just be in addition to the support role.
