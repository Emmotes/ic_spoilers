# Havilar

Havilar's twin sister Farideh has always been 'the smart one' and 'the responsible one'-but that's all right, Havilar is definitely 'the tough one,' 'the funny one' and the 'pretty one' (despite being identical twins). Plus, Havilar has a hellhound! Even if it means she's a sort-of-but-not-quite Chosen of Asmodeus, too, not that anyone asked Havi about that. But he should know her glaive is as good as her right hand, and she can slice a devil just as well as an orc, a zombie, or any other villain!

# Changes

Havilar will be a reworked champion in the Feast of the Moon event and delayed until 12 November 2025.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
