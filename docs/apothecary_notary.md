# Apothecary / Notary System

The presumed date for this system is on 12 March 2025 with the release of Sheila - though it could come out before then.

Very little is known about this system at present. We have a few references in the definitions - but most of what we "know" is from Dev Insights.

## Currency

We know from Sheila that this system will have its own unique currency called Potion Reagents because Sheila will scavenge them from bosses. We don't yet know how they'll be attained otherwise though.

There could also be another currency because there's a text define called `legendary_vessels` (just like there's one for `potion_reagents`). The suspicion is that they will be required to make the Legendary potions below.

## Legendary Grade Potions

There'll be legendary potions from this system (not to be confused with legendary potions).

## Info From Dev Insights

We've been told a few things over the past few months/years about potential features for this system - so we don't really know which ones are still true or will be true when it releases. So - as ever - take this all with a significantly sized pile of salt.

- We will be able to combine/split potions and potentially also contracts to increase/decrease their rarity. If this is true we could finally consolidate all our green bounty contracts up to epic for ease of use. We've been told that this will not require the currency item.
- We will be able to convert potion types to other types. For example - Firebreath to Speed. We've been told this will require the currency item.
- We will be able to purchase the contents of chests directly with gems - skipping the buying of chests and then the opening of said chests. Apparently this will also automatically convert any bounty contracts we would have gotten directly into tokens. We don't know how well this will play with the auto-spend when an event ends.
- This system will not interact with legendary potions (not to be confused with legendary potions).
