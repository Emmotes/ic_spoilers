# Apothecary / Notary System

The presumed date for this system is on 12 March 2025 with the release of Sheila - though it could come out before then.

Very little is known about this system at present. We have a few references in the definitions - but most of what we "know" is from Dev Insights - so take everything with a significant portion of salt.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">ⓘ</span> *Note: We have been told that the Notary system will not be released at the same time as the Apothecary system. It will release at an indeterminate time later.*

## Apothecary

This is a system that will allow dismantling potions and creating other potions with the reagents. I expect the primary use will be breaking down non-speed potions and using the materials to craft speed potions. The system will also add a higher tier of potion called legendary potions (not to be confused with legendary potions).

## Notary

This is a system that will allow converting contracts - primarily combining lower rarities into higher rarities - so that it's not so much of a chore to use bounty contracts every event. (50 large bounties contracts are equivalent to 800 smalls after all.)

It will also let us buy the contents of gold and silver chests directly for gems - and any bounty contracts earned that way will apparently immediately convert into event tokens. This will save the need to buy chests and then open the chests.

## Currencies

The first of the currencies are Potion Reagents and we will get them from dismantling potions - as well as from Sheila due to her scavenger ability. The reagents are what will be used to craft potions.

The second of the currencies are Legendary Vessels. The assumption is that they'll be used to craft the legendary potions (not to be confused with legendary potions). We know there'll be a premium bundle to buy these and there is data to potentially suggest that we could maybe get some via the Daily Platinum claim at least once a week. Possibly. We don't know if there'll be any other ways to get them via free-to-play.

## Legendary Grade Potions

There'll be Legendary potions from this system (not to be confused with legendary potions). They will be a tier higher than Huge and will last for one day (and will persist between adventures).

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">ⓘ</span> *Note: We've been told that the Apothecary/Notary systems will not interact in any way with the legendary potions (not to be confused with legendary potions) created with Scales of Tiamat in the Legendary Forge system.*
