# Spelljammer Campaign
We don't know a whole lot about this campaign - and it's coming out very soon - 14 September 2022 - so I'm not going to put a lot of effort into this page. We do know that it will be called `Light of Xaryxis` - and that its biggest curiosity is its formation.

## Divine Favour
The Divine Favour for Spelljammer will be `Celestian` - and it's already in-game.

## Formation

The devs say this is an 11 slot formation - and it certainly looks like it. That said - the defines do have an escort NPC `Squiddly` in the central column for at least one adventure. So it clearly won't always be 11.

I don't really know how the defines work in that regard - so the escort could be there for more adventures than that - or even there permanently. We'll have to wait and see.
