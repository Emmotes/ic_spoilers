# Spelljammer Campaign
We don't know a whole lot about this campaign - and it's coming out very soon - probably 7 September 2022 - so I'm not going to put a lot of effort into this page. We do know that it will be called `Light of Xaryxis` - and that its biggest curiosity is its formation.

## Divine Favour
The Divine Favour for Spelljammer will be `Celestian` - and it's already in-game.

## Formation

The devs claim this is an 11 slot formation - and while *technically* it is - one of the slots is taken up by a permanent escort - so it's a 10 slot formation.

It's possible that adventures or variants may move or remove the escort - so it may be 11 slots at some point? Only the devs can answer that.

## Blessings
The blessings helpfully leaked for a few minutes the other day - so here they are.
