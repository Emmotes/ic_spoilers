# Idle Champions Presents #7

We don't yet know what this ICP will be called yet - or when it will be - or who all the characters that will be in it are - or who will be playing them. We are fairly sure that two of them will be Aeon and Umberto though.

Umberto and Aeon being in the ICP does point to it likely being run throughout July during Founders' Day - maybe starting a bit before - or maybe extending a little after.

For anyone unaware - Idle Champions Presents is a set of once-a-week live-play streams that CNE occasionally run involving content creators for some of the champions in-game. B. Dave Walters usually DMs (but not always). Throughout the duration of the weeks of streaming - an in-game feature will let you vote on the happenings in the upcoming stream and you'll be able to buy various things with the voting tokens you earn by doing so.
