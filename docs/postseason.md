# Prior Season Reward Availabilities

When a season ends - most of the items that were available in the season pass track become exclusive and unavailable for a period of six months - at which point they become available again. Usually this means everything goes into Wild Offers (including the feats) while feats also become available for gems.

Modron cores that were in the season pass are added to Wild Offers - but we still don't know where modron cores that were in the free track will end up.
