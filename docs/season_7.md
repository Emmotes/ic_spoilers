# Season 7

![Season 7 Banner](images/season_7/banner.png)

Season 7 will be called `The Rivals` and is expected to start on 03 January 2024.

# Theme

![Shaka Season Portrait](images/season_7/shaka.png)![Selise Season Portrait](images/season_7/selise.png)![D'hani Season Portrait](images/season_7/dhani.png)![Kent Season Portrait](images/season_7/kent.png)![Virgil Season Portrait](images/season_7/virgil.png)

The five seasonal champions this time around will be Shaka Selise D'hani Kent and Virgil. We know this because the seasonal chest will be `Gold Rivals Chest` and it contains loot for those champions.

This means the theme this season is Rivals of Waterdeep champions.

# Changes

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
