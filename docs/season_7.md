# Season 7

Season 7 is expected to start on 17 January 2024.

# Theme

![Shaka Season Portrait](images/season_7/shaka.png)![Selise Season Portrait](images/season_7/selise.png)![D'hani Season Portrait](images/season_7/dhani.png)![Unknown Season Champion Portrait](images/general/unknown_champion.png)![Unknown Season Champion Portrait](images/general/unknown_champion.png)

We only have data for three seasonal champions so far. They are Shaka, Selise and D'hani. The rest are as yet unknown.

# Changes

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.

# Shaka
