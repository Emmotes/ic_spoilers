A new campaign was recently added to the defines: `Turn of Fortune's Wheel` or just `Fortune's Wheel` for short.

# Theme

It seems it will be Planescape / Sigil related - given the reference to the Fortune's Wheel tavern.

# Favour

The campaign favour will be `Fortune's Favor`.

# Formation

The formation in the spoilers is currently a placeholder and not likely to go live. I will update when it does.

# Content Drops

Based on its appearance in the defines - the expected date of the campaign launch will be 1 November 2023. See the [Content Drops](contentdrops.md) page for more details.
