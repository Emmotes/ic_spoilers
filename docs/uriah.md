# Uriah

Brother Uriah Macawber is a native of Ravenloft, born in in the domain of Darkon under the iron rule of the wizard-king Azalin Rex. Like many benighted residents of the Domains of Dread, he and his family sought succor in the arms of the Church of Ezra. He joined the priesthood of the Lady of the Mists upon coming of age, seeking to offer Her divine grace and protection to those in need.
