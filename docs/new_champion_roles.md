# New Champion Roles

In the data and on the Dev Insights stream - we've seen hints of new roles that champions will be able to get.

## Hunter

This role is basically for any champion with a Favoured Foe mechanic. This is the most developed upcoming role in the data so far. It has even been given to some champions already - it's just not visible in-game yet.

It has been given to the following champions:

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dynaheir | Jaheira | Minsc | Turiel | Wyll |
| Ezmerelda | Krux | Nerys | Uriah | Zorbu |
| Imoen | Lae'zel | Reya | Vin Ursa |  |

## Control

This is a role that will be given to champions that are able to slow stun snare or knockback. It hasn't currently been given to any champions yet - but there is data in the definitions laying the groundwork for it.

## Armour Breaker

This is a role that will be given to champions that can make dealing with armoured or hits-based enemies easier or quicker. Either by breaking more segments per hit or by lowering the damage threshold for armoured enemies to take damage or even fast-repeating damage ultimates. That kind of thing.

This is the least known about upcoming role. There's not even any data in the definitions for it yet. The only hints have been from Justin on the Dev Insights stream.
