# Modes

This is a little not-so-hidden page that I made for enabling / disabling the different modes someone suggested I make as a joke.

Each mode will find certain text on the page and replace it. Simple as that.

***Note: I do not - in any way - support the ridiculous mess that can result from enabling any of these modes.***
