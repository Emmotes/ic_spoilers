# Yorven

Yorven Springpaw disappeared from the Feywild as a child after an encounter with a malicious coven of hags. He ended up lost in the Shadowfell, where he embraced his innate primal spirit to survive. The power of this ancient feral beast helped Yorven do more than survive the dangers of the Shadowfell -- he thrived. When Yorven came across the Witchlight Carnival he managed to convince the owners to bring him on board. When the Witchlight Carnival returned to the Feywild years later, Yorven moved on, seeking his childhood home - and the hags who banished him.

# Changes

Yorven will be a reworked champion in the The Great Modron March event on 14 May 2025 (guesstimated a week after event start potentially due to the Worst the Wait event augment).

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.

> Every 10 areas an additional raven spawns in the swarm, capped at 50 ravens.  
>   
> Getting to Know Yorven: If you choose the Hunger for Blood specialization, once Yorven defeats an enemy, he'll jump to another enemy to attack them as well!
</div></div>

![Fangclaw Icon](images/yorven/12278.png) **Variant 2: Fangclaw** (Complete Area 125)
> In each boss area, a vicious rabbit boss enemy appears. It must also be defeated in order to progress.   
> Gold Find is reduced by 99%  
> Only Champions with DEX of 14 or higher can be used.
</div></div>

![Raven Queen's Memories Icon](images/yorven/12279.png) **Variant 3: Raven Queen's Memories** (Complete Area 175)
> Yorven Springpaw is haunted by his time in the shadowfell.

> If Yorven is in the formation, the increase is only 2 seconds.   
> Enemies move 200% faster.
