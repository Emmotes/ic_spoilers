Season 3 will end on 24 May 2023 and there's usually a 2-4 week gap between seasons. This means the current guesstimate start for season 4 is early-mid June.

Given the appearance of skins for Companions of the Hall - all called `Mythic` on 14 June 2023 (a date very close to where I would expect new season skins to appear) - it seems like that they'll be the focus of season 4. If this is true - that will mean the start date for the season will be 21 June 2023.

No changes worth talking about have been seen in the defines yet - so this is just an educated guess at this point.
