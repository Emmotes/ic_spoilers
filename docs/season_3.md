# Season 3

Season 2 will be ending on 1 March 2023 - and Season 3 is likely to start around 2-4 weeks later depending on CNE's schedule. Mid-to-late March is a safe guess.

The champion changes and time gate cost reduction will all be going live on #DATEPREVIEW - while the actual Season 2 start date will be #DATEACTUAL.

The information below is raw data on the "new" abilities that the champions will be getting. Some may be complete reworks - some may look copy-paste from old abilities that haven't seen reworks yet (and might not get reworked).

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
