# Notary System

This system's release - "It's very close...ish" (said Justin on a recent Dev Insights).

Very little is known about this system at present. We have a few references in the definitions - but most of what we "know" is from Dev Insights - so take everything with a significant portion of salt.

This is a system that will allow converting contracts - primarily combining lower rarities into higher rarities - so that it's not so much of a chore to use bounty contracts every event. (50 large bounties contracts are equivalent to 800 smalls after all.)

It will also let us buy the contents of gold and silver chests directly for gems - and any bounty contracts earned that way will apparently immediately convert into event tokens. This will save the need to buy chests and then open the chests.

## Currencies

We don't yet know whether this system will have any currency items.
