# Sgt. Knox

The imposing presence of Sergeant Knox came to Neverwinter when the Mintarn mercenaries were hired to retake the city following the eruption of Mount Hotenow. Soon he became a daily presence and mentor for new Adventurers in the city. Celeste reached out to her old friend following the catastrophic events at Elturel, hoping the veteran mercenary would join the Champions as they face the greatest foe the Sword Coast has ever seen!

# Changes

Sgt. Knox will be a reworked champion in the Feast of the Moon event on 6 November 2024.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
