# Feast of the Giants Celebration

Hints of a possible celebration (potentially seasonal) have been added. The graphics for it call it Feast of the Giants. The assumed start date for this will be 10 April 2025. It is unknown whether this will have a legendary dismantle or not.

We know from the graphics that it will contain the `Death Giant Kas` skin as well as some kind of generic feat. The suspicion is that the feat will be his `Soul Shroud (80% Born Into Evil)` feat.
