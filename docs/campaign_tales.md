# New Campaign - Tales of the Champions

A new campaign was recently added to the defines: `Tales of the Champions`. The confirmed date of release is 27 August 2025 from a [Reddit Q&A](https://www.reddit.com/r/idlechampions/comments/1lq1490/reddit_qa_258_with_exec_producer_chris/) and shown on the [Content Drops](contentdrops.md) page.

# Unlock Champions

This campaign will allow you to unlock some event champions by completing adventures. This info is based on a text define called `campaign_13_header_text`:

> Tales of the Champions is a special Campaign where you can unlock Event Champions outside Events and Time Gates. Each one-shot adventure unlocks the featured Champion (if you don't own them) and has three Adventure Variants containing unique rewards available from the start.

Based on the icons in the [Content Drops](contentdrops.md) page - the first six featured champions appear to be Ezmerelda, Catti-brie, Melf, Lae'zel, Strongheart and Dynaheir.

# Tutorial

There is a game rule define called `tales_tutorial`. I'm not sure what this means for the campaign yet.

# Favour

The current name for the favour for this campaign is `Red Knight`.
