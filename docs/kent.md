#### Abilities

Rapier (Base Attack)
> Kent strikes the closest enemy with his rapier.

Ultimate: Wails from the Grave
> The weather changes to fog. For 30 seconds, whenever Kent attacks, a ghostly spirit is summoned and attacks an additional enemy if possible dealing BUD damage.

Soul Trinket (Guess)
> Kent keeps a soul trinket of the highest level boss defeated in each campaign (and the highest level boss defeated in all events) where he was present. Kent increases the damage of all Champions in his column by $(amount)% for each Soul Trinket level.

Nostalgia (Guess)
> Each time Kent or the ghostly spirit from his ultimate attacks, he gains a Nostalgia stack that lasts until entering a new area. Kent increases his damage by $(not_buffed amount)% for each Nostalgia stack, stacking multiplicatively and then applied multiplicatively. Buffs are applied to the post stack value, and Nostalgia stacks are capped at $(max_stacks) stacks.

Name Unknown

Name Unknown
> Kent increases the attack bonus of $(upgrade_name id) by $(amount)% for each Rivals of Waterdeep Champion, stacking multiplicatively and applied multiplicatively.

Name Unknown
> Whenever Kent attacks an enemy and doesn't kill it, it is affected by a virulent poison. The poison deals $(seconds_of_bud) seconds worth of BUD to the enemy each second for $(total_seconds) seconds.
