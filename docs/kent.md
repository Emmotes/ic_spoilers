# Kent

A former archaeologist turned adventurer, Kentucky 'Kent' Jones honed his skills exploring a temple of Talona, goddess of poison and plague. While his team didn't survive the temple's defenses, he returned home to the lakeside town of Caradoon. Still a flamboyant Tiefling, Kent carries a darkness that he does his best to keep hidden. But he doesn't bear the darkness alone. After returning to Caradoon, he met smart and PATIENT Aasimar, Virgil. Together they've flourished, even after accidentally poisoning the ground under a local tavern in an effort to get rid of a few rats and fleeing Caradoon only to meet up with Selise Astorio and join the Rivals.

Remembering the Old Days (Level: 100)
