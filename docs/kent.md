# Kent
A former archaeologist turned adventurer, Kentucky 'Kent' Jones honed his skills exploring a temple of Talona, goddess of poison and plague. While his team didn't survive the temple's defenses, he returned home to the lakeside town of Caradoon. Still a flamboyant Tiefling, Kent carries a darkness that he does his best to keep hidden. But he doesn't bear the darkness alone. After returning to Caradoon, he met smart and PATIENT Aasimar, Virgil. Together they've flourished, even after accidentally poisoning the ground under a local tavern in an effort to get rid of a few rats and fleeing Caradoon only to meet up with Selise Astorio and join the Rivals.

# Abilities

Rapier (Base Attack)
> Kent strikes the closest enemy with his rapier.

Ultimate: Wails from the Grave
> The weather changes to fog. For 30 seconds, whenever Kent attacks, a ghostly spirit is summoned and attacks an additional enemy if possible dealing BUD damage.

Tokens of the Departed
> Kent keeps a soul trinket of the highest level boss defeated in each campaign (and the highest level boss defeated in all events) where he was present. Kent increases the damage of all Champions in his column by `$(amount)%` for each Soul Trinket level.

Remembering the Old Days
> Each time Kent or the ghostly spirit from his ultimate attacks, he gains a Nostalgia stack that lasts until entering a new area. Kent increases his damage by $(not_buffed amount)% for each Nostalgia stack, stacking multiplicatively and then applied multiplicatively. Buffs are applied to the post stack value, and Nostalgia stacks are capped at `$(max_stacks)` stacks.

EXTRA!
> Kent's force of personality emboldens his companions. Kent increases the damage of all Champions by your current Achievement bonus.

Inseparable (Guess)
> If Virgil qualifies for an adventure restriction based on his tags, age, ability scores, etc., Kent may be used as well.

# Specialisations
Potent Poison
> Whenever Kent attacks an enemy and doesn't kill it, it is affected by a virulent poison. The poison deals `$(seconds_of_bud)` seconds worth of BUD to the enemy each second for `$(total_seconds)` seconds.

Robust Rivals
> Kent increases the attack bonus of `$(upgrade_name id)` by `$(amount)%` for each Rivals of Waterdeep Champion, stacking multiplicatively and applied multiplicatively.
