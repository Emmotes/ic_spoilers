# Feats

Feats that are upcoming.

Feats that are listed as Free will be available immediately the moment they release. Feats with a cost of 50,000 Gems will usually also be available via real money through DLC packs or weekend chest sales. Gold chest feats of course can only come from regular Gold Chests.

*Note: I filter out all feats that are obviously tests or unfinished - such as having a prohibitively high gem cost or excessive too-far-future release date.*

# Placeholder Date Feats

These are the feats that have been filtered out of the list above due to having placeholder dates. By this I mean they have very far future dates that will eventually change when CNE deigns to release them (*IF* they decide to release them). They've been filtered out above purely because there's a possibility some of these might never see the light of day. They're unreliable - far more so than most spoilers usually are. So take that into account when viewing them.

*Note: Test feats / QA feats / TBD feats will remain filtered out. Even from this list.*

# Seat Swap Feats

These icons entered the defines a while ago - and we recently got the first appearance of a feat that uses them. Given that - it seems that these will be handed out sparingly to select champions that specifically allow them to move to one specific seat. I highly doubt they'll be a free-for-all.
