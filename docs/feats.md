# Feats

Feats that are upcoming.

Feats that are listed as Free will be available immediately the moment they release. Feats with a cost of 50,000 Gems will usually also be available via real money through DLC packs or weekend chest sales. Gold chest feats of course can only come from regular Gold Chests.

*Note: I filter out all feats that are obviously tests or unfinished - such as having a prohibitively high gem cost or excessive too-far-future release date.*

# Seat Swap Feats

These icons entered the defines recently. They clearly suggest that there will be feats at some point in the future that will allow a champion to move seat. We know nothing about how they'll be distributed - but it's likely that they'll be given out sparsely and only to one specific seat when they are given. So don't expect to be able to use whoever you want in a formation regardless of seat.
