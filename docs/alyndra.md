# Alyndra

Alyndra Alexandria Garanahil Sarrbarand is known by many names: Lorekeeper of Rime Spiro, Kinscribe of Clan Monkeymouse, Daughter of Oblivion, Fate Changer, Knight of Wonder and Captivation...and apologetic offspring of Avren & Sofieus.

# Changes

Alyndra will be a reworked champion in the Highharvestide event and delayed until 10 September 2025.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
