# Nordom

Modrons are the embodiment of law and order, marching in lockstep through the planes. But when Nordom Whistleklik was separated from his fellow modrons, the essence of chaos infected this rogue quadrone. Now with his crossbow-shaped gear spirits in hand, he works to fit his complex new outlook into his logical-if quirky-understanding of the planes.

# Changes

Nordom will be a reworked champion in the Simril event and delayed until 10 December 2025.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
