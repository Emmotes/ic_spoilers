# Patron 5

We now know that Elminster Aumar will be the fifth patron in this game. This is because of an ability Gale will have:  
> As an Ally of Elminster, Gale can be used in any Elminster Patron adventure or variant, even if he would not normally be available to be used due to variant or patron restrictions.

## Date

Given that there are feats that list Patron 5 as their source and are dated 3 April 2024 - and Gale who is releasing on 3 April 2024 has Elminster referenced in an ability - it's guesstimated that that is also the release date of Patron 5.

Justin also said "April" when asked about potential Patron 5 release dates on a recent Dev Insights.

## Restrictions

As we've seen from the video on [Gale's Spotlight blog](https://www.codenameentertainment.com/?page=idle_champions#blog) that includes a picture of Patron 5 - we know the restriction is:  
> Only champions released or reworked in an event in past 3 years can be used.

It's poor grammer but it means `(released or reworked) in an event`. Which means Evergreens cannot be used in Elminster patron variants. It also means that as time progresses - older champions will become too old to be eligible but new champions will also release and be available. Justin has said (and I quote):  
> He'll trend toward a rotating set of 48 Champions.

I made a list of all champions and their eligibility for Elminster for the date of his release: [Elminster Champion Eligibility List](patron_5_champions.html).
