# Patron 5

We now know that Elminster Aumar will be the fifth patron in this game. This is because of an ability Gale will have:  
> As an Ally of Elminster, Gale can be used in any Elminster Patron adventure or variant, even if he would not normally be available to be used due to variant or patron restrictions.

## Date

Given that there are feats that list Patron 5 as their source and are dated 3 April 2024 - and Gale who is releasing on 3 April 2024 has Elminster referenced in an ability - it's guesstimated that that is also the release date of Patron 5.

Justin also said "April" when asked about potential Patron 5 release dates on a recent Dev Insights.

## Restrictions

When it comes to what the restrictions for Patron 5 will be - all we have to go on are snippets of answers to questions found on the Developer Insights stream. Those being that the restrictions will vary.

Justin mentioned the idea of the patron having a set of available champions that would change every month. Unfortunately - that is just talk at this point. There's no data to back that up yet.

The __**guess**__ for his restriction is that it will be the same - or very similar - to Gale's 3rd variant restriction - which is:

> You may only use the base 12 Core Champions and/or Champions that have been released in the last 3 years.

It's possible Elminster will also include champions reworked in the last 3 years and not include the core 12 - but really all we have to go on is speculation.
