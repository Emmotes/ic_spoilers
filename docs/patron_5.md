# Patron 5

As you may have seen by looking at the [Feats](feats.html) page - hints of Patron 5 have started turning up in the game data. So far - this only extends to knowing that a 5th patron exists - not who they will be.

## Date

Given that the feats that list Patron 5 as their source are dated 3 April 2024 - it can potentially be speculated that that is the release date of Patron 5. But we don't do speculation here.

## Restrictions

When it comes to what the restrictions for Patron 5 will be - all we have to go on are snippets of answers to questions found on the Developer Insights stream. Those being that the restrictions will vary.

Justin mentioned the idea of the patron having a set of available champions that would change every month. Unfortunately - that is just talk at this point. There's no data to back that up yet.
