# Evandra

This is PURELY A GUESS. I don't know if Evandra will be directly after Strongheart - but she will be close. There is a "Witchlight Evandra" skin dated for 2032 (placeholder date) and she'll be the 3rd member of Awful Ones (Guess) affiliation.

Evandra is a "half-elf fighter" from the 1 For All sketch show.
