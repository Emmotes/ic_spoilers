# Farideh

Abandoned as an infant and adopted by an outcast dragonborn warrior, Farideh grew to adulthood acutely aware of the drawbacks of being a tiefling. While those from the Nine Hells do their utmost to corrupt her, Farideh isn't interested in power so much as defending the world from demons, the undead, and any other villains trying to bring trouble or drag her friends and family into danger.

# Changes

Farideh will be a reworked champion in the Liars' Night event and delayed until 8 October 2025.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
