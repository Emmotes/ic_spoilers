# Ellywick

Ellywick Tumblestrum has created music of such stirring quality that she was once invited to the Feywild where she played for the Summer Queen and the Queen of Air and Darkness. So moved were the two queens that they gifted the bard with her instrument, Morningmist. Tumblestrum's affinity for the Feywild brought her and her frog companion, Groak, to the Witchlight Carnival, where she spins tales and sings songs about the Plane of Faerie.

# Changes

Ellywick is potentially a reworked champion in the Ahghairon's Day event on 7 August 2024.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.
