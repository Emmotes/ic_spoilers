# Abilities

Short Bow (Base Attack)
> Imoen shoots a random enemy with her bow. Once her specialization is unlocked, she does an additional 5 seconds worth of BUD based damage.

Disarm Traps (Ultimate)
> Imoen leaps out into the fray, attacking five enemies in sequence with her short sword in one hand and her lockpicks in the other. She prioritizes enemies with hits-based health and deals 5 hits per attack; if no hits-based enemies are available she deals normal ultimate damage to enemies she attacks.

Unknown Name (Stack Title: Perseverance Stacks)
> Any time any Champion's Favored Foe appears or is defeated, Imoen increases the effect of `$(upgrade_name id)` by `$(amount)%`, stacking multiplicatively and then applying multiplicatively. Stacks up to `$(max_stacks)` times. Stacks are reset each time the Champions change areas.

Polymorph (Guess)
> Before every third attack, Imoen polymorphs a random non-boss non-static enemy into a monster with the same type as her Favored Foe, but only 10% of its original health. She can not polymorph enemies that are already polymorphed by this ability a second time.  
> Animals: Polymorphed Rabbit / Faerie Dragon / Gremishka / Gazer

Favored Foe
