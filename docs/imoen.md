# Imoen

Imoen is a surprisingly cheerful young woman considering she eventually discovered that she was the child of a deadly murder god. As an orphan, she moved to Candlekeep at the age of 10 with her adoptive father and innkeeper, Winthrop. She eventually traveled to Baldur's Gate with a childhood friend, where she joined forces with powerful Champions like Minsc and Jaheria.

# Formation

![Formation Layout](images/formation_imoen.png)

# Abilities

Base Attack: Short Bow
> Imoen shoots a random enemy with her bow.

Ultimate Attack: Disarm Traps (Level: 100)
> Imoen leaps out into the fray, attacking five enemies in sequence with her short sword in one hand and her lockpicks in the other. She prioritizes enemies with hits-based health and deals 5 hits per attack; if no hits-based enemies are available she deals normal ultimate damage to enemies she attacks.

Optimism (Level: 10)
> Imoen increases the damage of adjacent Champions by `$(amount)%`.

Perseverance (Level: 60)
> Any time any Champion's Favored Foe appears or is defeated, Imoen increases the effect of Optimism by `$(amount)%`, stacking multiplicatively and then applying multiplicatively. Stacks up to 50 times. Stacks are reset each time the Champions change areas.

Stoneskin (Level: 80)
> Before every eighth attack, or upon entering a new area, Imoen casts Stoneskin on all Champions in the front-most column of the formation, granting them `$(not_buffed amount)` temporary hit points. The amount is increased by 5% (additively) for each Favored Foe that is alive.

Polymorph (Level: 130)
> Before every third attack, Imoen polymorphs a random non-boss non-static enemy into a monster with the same type as her Favored Foe, but only 10% of its original health. She can not polymorph enemies that are already polymorphed by this ability a second time.
