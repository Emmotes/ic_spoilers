# Mehen

Mehen's life changed three times: once when he was exiled from the dragonborn stronghold of Djerad Thymar for refusing to be his tyrannical father's puppet; once when he took in twin tiefling babies abandoned in the snow; and once when his teenaged daughter, Farideh, made a pact with a devil from the Nine Hells. But Mehen is both adaptable and resilient; nothing out there will break his love for his daughters, his sense of self, or the strike of his falchion.

# Changes

Mehen will be a reworked champion in the Wintershield event on 1 January 2025.

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.

# Adventures and Variants

<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
**Unlock Adventure: The Mechanical Menace (Mehen)** (Complete Area 50)
> Stop the Modron March from crushing Waterdeep under its mechanical heel.
</div></div>
<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
![The Elusive Bounty Icon](images/mehen/10503.png) **Variant 1: The Elusive Bounty** (Complete Area 75)
> Mehen starts in the formation. He can be moved. The pixie arrives in each boss area to taunt Mehen, buffing all enemies so they move 100% faster and deal 100% additional damage. You must defeat her in addition to the area requirements to advance. Getting to know Mehen: To maximize Mehen's benefit within your formation, you'll want to watch his Grumpy stacks and keep them within the middle range. Mehen gains Grumpy stacks based on which column he is in with a gain of 1 stack per second in the front row, to 5 stacks per second in the back row. Mehen loses Grumpy stacks when one of the following things happens to either Mehen, Havilar or Farideh: They attack (10% loss), they take damage (10% loss), or they kill an enemy (5% loss).

![The Neverending March Continues Icon](images/mehen/10504.png) **Variant 2: The Neverending March Continues** (Complete Area 125)
> Every time a Modron is killed in non-boss areas it shuts down for 5 seconds and then comes back to life with full health. Modron enemies deal 100% additional damage.
</div></div>
<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
![Volo's Guide to Grumpy Guys Icon](images/mehen/10505.png) **Variant 3: Volo's Guide to Grumpy Guys** (Complete Area 175)
> Volo has returned to observe the formation. Only Male Champions can be used. Enemies move 100% faster, and deal 100% additional damage. Getting to know Mehen: While Mehen works best with his daughters Farideh & Havilar he's no slouch on his own. Without the Brimstone Angels in your formation, you need to manage Mehen's Grumpy stacks a bit differently. Remember that changing his column will alter how quickly he is gaining Grumpy stacks.
