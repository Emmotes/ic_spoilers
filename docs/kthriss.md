# K'thriss

Curious, affable, and morbid, the drow heretic K'thriss Drow'b seeks the insane god-truth behind the veil of reality. As the 'C' Team's hoardsperson, he keeps an eye out for occult relics that could aid him in his unearthly quest.

# Changes

K'thriss will be a reworked champion in the Founders' Day event on 9 July 2025 (guesstimated a week after event start potentially due to the Worst the Wait event augment).

Only abilities that have seen some changes will be displayed here - and be aware that there's a lot of guesswork involved. Some abilities may not have names - some may have the *wrong* names - or specialisations might not be marked as such - etc.. Focus on the effect data itself.

Please do me a favour and don't get all melodramatic about what you find here. I - and CNE - don't appreciate it. These are spoilers and will almost certainly change before release - likely multiple times. That and we don't have access to any upgrade data prior to release. Making assumptions on how the champions will turn out based on this information would be premature.

# Adventures and Variants

<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
**Unlock Adventure: Deadwinter Day (K'thriss)** (Complete Area 50)
> Patrol the outskirts of Longsaddle on Deadwinter Day.
</div></div>
<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
![Velvet's Midwinter Adventure Icon](images/kthriss/4744.png) **Variant 1: Velvet's Midwinter Adventure** (Complete Area 75)
> K'thriss and his unseen servant Velvet take up slots in the formation and cannot be moved or swapped out. Velvet is overzealous in their task and reduces your gold find by 50%, but stacks K'thriss' Hoardsperson ability faster (once unlocked). Velvet also causes those adjacent to them to receive K'thriss's Unseen Encouragement.
</div></div>
<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
![Truth Beyond Knowing Icon](images/kthriss/4745.png) **Variant 2: Truth Beyond Knowing** (Complete Area 125)
> A drow cultist empowered by the sign of Ur appears in every area. When killed, the cultist drops a Tetrathanotic Glyph, which increases the damage of Champions with an INT score of 13+ by 5%. Those not intelligent enough to understand the book lose 5% of their damage. These buffs stack and remain in effect until the adventure is completed.
</div></div>
<div markdown="1" class="abilityBorder"><div markdown="1" class="abilityBorderInner">
![More Like The Scream Team Icon](images/kthriss/4747.png) **Variant 3: More Like The Scream Team** (Complete Area 175)
> The Devourer now appears as an additional area 25 boss, in addition to its normal role as the area 50 boss. As if that wasn't scary enough, the Devourer now only takes 8 seconds to devour a Champion, down from 10. The dialog on this adventure is slightly tweaked.
